🚗 Car Sales Analysis — What 50,000 Used Cars Taught Me About Value, Wear, and Buyer Behavior

I recently analyzed a massive dataset of used car sales to understand what really drives price.
Spoiler: it’s not just mileage or engine size — human behavior and brand perception play a huge role too 👀

Through data cleaning, visualization, and pattern discovery, I found:
📉 Price drops sharply with mileage (especially in the first 100K km)
⚙️ Engine size and brand reputation add strong positive influence
⛽ Fuel type & transmission slightly tweak buyer preference
📈 Correlation heatmaps reveal fascinating trade-offs between power, age, and price

The project dives into how factors like age, mileage, engine capacity, and brand loyalty shape resale value — and what this means for both buyers and sellers.

This wasn’t just an analysis — it was storytelling through data. Every scatter plot and heatmap revealed how numbers reflect real-world choices.


Would love your thoughts!
What’s the first thing you look for when buying a used car — price, mileage, or brand?
